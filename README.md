Broker: Dungeon Difficulty
====================

A Data Broker addon for quickly noticing or switching your dungeon and raid difficulties. Put it somewhere just prominent enough to notice before you zone in and start looking for a keystone font in a normal dungeon!

Get it on [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25712-BrokerDungeonDifficulty.html), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/broker-dungeon-difficulty), or use the [Cursebreaker tool](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker) (recommended)
